#### Notes & Use

Calculates the relationship between HP, Force, and Velocity; this is for use when determining rough order of magnitude power transmissions.

This calculator will calculate for either velocity or force at any given time by specifiying the variable to solve for.

#### Terms

P = Motor power, *horsepower*

&eta; = efficiency, *percent*

v   = velocity of line, *feet per second*

F   = force of line, *pounds force*

#### Equations

##### Velocity

$$ v = \frac {550P}{F} \eta $$ 

##### Force

$$ F =  \frac {550P}{v} \eta $$

##### Power

$$ P = \frac {F \\, v}{550 \eta}  $$
