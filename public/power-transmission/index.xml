      <description>Notes &amp;amp; Use Calculates the relationship between HP, Force, and Velocity; this is for use when determining rough order of magnitude power transmissions.
This calculator will calculate for either velocity or force at any given time by specifiying the variable to solve for.
Terms P = Motor power, horsepower
η = efficiency, percent
v = velocity of line, feet per second
F = force of line, pounds force
Equations Velocity $$ v = \frac {550P}{F} \eta $$</description>

      <description>Notes &amp;amp; Use Calculates for various motion-related values:
 time max velocity acceleration deceleration distance  Motion profiles are assumed to be trapezoidal in nature, with constant accel, decel, and max speed.
The following calculation order is observed&amp;hellip;
 Changing any value (except Time) will recalculate the Time value The Accel &amp;amp; Decel values (f/s2) will remain constant unless the Accel/Decel Distance values are edited. The Top Speed value will remain constant unless the Time value is edited.</description>

      <title>Piston Force &amp; Speed</title>

      <description>Notes &amp;amp; Use The first section calculates the push force and pull force of a pneumatic/hydraulic piston, with the folowing considerations&amp;hellip;
 The cylinder bore and rod have circular cross-sections, The rod Ø must not exceed the bore Ø The pressure on the opposing face of the piston cup (not the pressuring side) is assumed to be at standard atmospheric pressure  The second part of this calculator calculates values related to the piston speed and displacement, where:</description>

      <description>Notes &amp;amp; Usage Calculates a simple winch arragement in which there exists:
 A motor A reduction stage A drum or sprocket stage with constant diameter  This calculator will recalculate if any of the values are changed. There are three sets of calculations performed depending on the values that are changed. Each set of calculations are based on the formulas provided in the Calculation section.
 When the force is changed, the speed is re-calculated When the velocity is changed, the force is re-calculated When any other variable is changed, the velocity and force are both re-calculated.</description>

      <description>Notes &amp;amp; Usage Calculates a simple winch arragement in which there exists:
 A motor A reduction stage A yoyo (or pilewind) drum.  The behavior of this system is such that at any time during the machine&amp;rsquo;s operation, the linepull velocity and force are changing depending on the diameter of the drum. E.g. as the motor drives at a constant speed, the drum pulls in cable. As the machine takes up cable, the effective diameter of the drum increases, with the following effects:</description>
